## Abstract

Pastalogy presents a new axiomatic theory of the universe developed from a single assumption: matter is divisible, but not infinitely so. From this principle, all propositions of the theory are deductively derived, including the nature of fundamental particles—*pastons*, the concepts of space and time, and the explanation of emergent phenomena. Gravity is interpreted as a pressure effect from ubiquitous background pastons, light as ordered clusters of pastons, and wave-particle duality arises from particle interactions with the interfering background. Cosmological puzzles such as dark matter and dark energy are resolved without additional entities: large pastons explain dark matter, while accelerated expansion is not posited, eliminating the need for dark energy. Pastalogy offers testable predictions differing from standard physics, including the non-identity of gravitational and inertial mass for superdense objects and persistent interference in slit experiments even with a known particle path. This work positions Pastalogy as a standalone axiomatic science aiming to construct a complete and consistent picture of the universe.
